# face_morphing
This jupyter notebook implements 2 simplified versions of Face Morphing as proposed in Beier and Neely’s, “Feature-Based Image Metamorphosis” (SIGGRAPH 1992).  <br> 
It represents my submission for the second coursework at COMP0026 Image Processing. You can read more details about the requirements in the pdf file.  <br>  
Unfortunately, due to size restrictions, I am not able to upload all the files generated by the notebook, if you want to see them, download the repo, run the code and check out the results.  <br>  
The final results are available in the ./pics/video folder
