# face_morphing
This jupyter notebook implements 2 simplified versions of Face Morphing as proposed in Beier and Neely’s, “Feature-Based Image Metamorphosis” (SIGGRAPH 1992).  <br>
It represents my submission for the second coursework at COMP0026 Image Processing. You can read more details about the requirements in the pdf file.  <br> 
Implementation note: At part 4, instead of calculating a single deformation vector field, and then applying the formula O(x) = (1-w)S(x) + wE(x+d(x)), I computed the vector field with respect to some intermediate points and the final shape for each value of w. For each value w I compute some points at position (1-w)*initial + w*final, where initial and final is the position of the important points in the start and final matrix, and then compute the displacement vector field with respect to these points and the final image points and compute the image for w using this vector field. Basically, my formula for intermediate images becomes: O(x) = (1-w)S(x) + wE(x+d(x,w)), and in the formula for d, xs,i (the start position of correspondence i) is replaced by xi(w) = (1-w)\*xs,i + w\*xe,i. 
Unfortunately, due to size restrictions, I am not able to upload all the files generated by the notebook, if you want to see them, download the repo, run the code and check out the results.  <br>
The final results are available in the ./pics/video folder
